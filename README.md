# Mystery Island

A simple adventure game in which the goal is to reach one of the exit nodes with the highest score possible. Each move the player makes costs points; nodes with gold icons give bonus points, and the ones with skull points give penalties.

I planned to use this game in one of my EFL lesson plans, and I was supposed to complete it in a week or so. But I couldn't find the time back then and ended up ditching the idea. It's just a toy project now.

## Seed

The game requires a number to use as a seed in its internal random generation tool. This approach was needed for competitive play; as it needs to somehow produce the same amount of rewards/penalties at the same places for each player.
